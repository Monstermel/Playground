mTLS (mutual Transport Layer Security) is like a secret handshake for computers. 
It's a security method used by systems like gRPC to make sure they can trust each 
other over the internet. With mTLS, both the client and server use digital certificates 
to verify each other's identity, ensuring that only trusted parties can communicate 
securely. In simple terms, it's like having a locked door with two keys - both sides 
need to have the right key to open it, ensuring a safe connection.
